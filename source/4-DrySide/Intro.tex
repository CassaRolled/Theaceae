The dry side of the White Spine mountains is wild and sparsely populated.
While there are a handful of groups, such as the Adventuring Academy and Sisterhood in this region, most settlers here are fiercely independent.
Life on the dry side is hard, but the people find the hard life worth the space and freedom.
