The Sunny Slope Orchards is the most prominent of the local farms near the Adventuring Academy.
Hearty fruit trees have been carefully intermixed with the natural flora in the forest, following meandering paths.

Noah Frisch (dwarf male, ranger) is gruff and argumentative.
He carefully manages the forests around the Adventuring Academy and can often be overheard muttering about farmers improperly infringing upon the forest.
Noah is very protective of Sunny Slope Orchards and will chase off anyone who has not been invited by Patrik.

Patrik Frisch (human male, archdruid) is cautious and polite.
He takes care of the fruit trees, always looking to create more hardy trees that are better adapted to the climate of the Dry Side.
Patrik is happy to sell his fruits but is reticent to allow adventurers into the orchards without good reason.
