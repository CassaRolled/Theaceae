The Adventurers Academy is famous throughout Theaceae.
Young children throughout the dry side dream of being accepted into the Adventurers Academy and apprenticing with one of the senior adventurers.
Graduates are expected to embrace this spirit of generosity, charging fair rates for their services and giving back to the Adventurers Academy to support new apprentices.
Many of the homes in the area around the Academy belong to retired graduates who have come back to help teach new adventurers.
