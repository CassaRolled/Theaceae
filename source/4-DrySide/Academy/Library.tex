An unassuming stone structure on the outskirts of the main part of the town houses the portion of the library that is above ground.
The library extends into a maze below ground, with scrolls, books, maps and various artifacts laid out according to a cacophony of conflicting organization systems.
Despite the crumbling facade, the defenses that protect the tombs below have never been breached.

Eleonore Rothmann (human woman, archmage) is old and exceedingly frail.
She will only let people into the library if they are on Adventuring Academy business or have proven themselves trustworthy.
Calm and unflapable, Elonore always speaks in a whisper, even when she is not inside the library.
