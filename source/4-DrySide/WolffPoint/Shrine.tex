One shrine serves all of the religious needs for people in Wolff Point and the surrounding area.
In the center of the shrine sits a stone altar, one side carefully maintained and covered in intricate runes while the other is weathered and overgrown with plants.
Seating surrounds the altar, offering views of both sides.

Sister Amelia (human woman) is a retired member of the Sisterhood who recently moved to Wolff Point to manage the shrine.
While Sister Amelia worships Knowledge, through her studies she knows how to worship any of the six deities and will provide rites for any of them.
