A large, 6 foot tall carved badger standing rampant guards the entrance of the rough-hewn log and stone building that is Wolff Point's only inn.
Accommodations are basic and food is expensive, but the Majestic Badger is comfortable and there is often a traveling bard or a tinker visiting.
Food and rations cost double the prices listed in the Player's Handbook.

Balris Grirlei (elf man, bard) is heavyset and old enough that his hair has gone grey.
He is friendly but a man of few words, and he will only discuss the elves in the region with elven characters.
