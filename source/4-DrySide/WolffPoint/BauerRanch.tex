Bauer Ranch sits on the outskirts of Wolff Point.
The ranch extends into the foothills of the White Spine mountains and has the largest herd of goats on the Dry Side.
Goats are the best suited pack animals in the region and can be purchased for the price of a pony.

Lukas Bauer (human man) runs the ranch with his children.
He will sell his goats, but he requires some assurances that the purchasers are capable of properly taking care of the goats.
