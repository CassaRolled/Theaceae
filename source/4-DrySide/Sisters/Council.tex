The Sisterhood is run by a council of senior sisters.
These sisters represent the two main factions in the Sisterhood and a third sister to prevent deadlock.

Sister Frida (human woman, war priest) represents the sisters who worship Forge.
She is heavily scarred form leading several Verses in major battles over the years and she has lost many close sisters in the forest.
Sister Frida strongly advocates for leading Verses into the forest to impose order over the chaotic fey.

Sister Marie (elf woman, war priest) represents the sisters who worship Knowledge.
She is younger than the other two members of the council.
Sister Marie wants to understand the fey and local customs to appease them, which she sees is a far safer approach and far less costly in terms of lives of sisters.
She would like to reach an understanding with the fey.

Sister Elisabeth (human woman, war priest) acts as the balancing vote on the council and does not openly advocate for one faction or another.
She has been in the Sisterhood longer than many of the sisters have been alive.
Sister Elisabeth sees benefits to both Sister Frida and Sister Marie's approaches and tries to balance both.
