The Sisterhood is an isolated religious order of scholars and warriors that generally worships the siblings of order.
This all woman order trains girls from birth to take a place in their order.

While people on the dry side know that the Sisterhood will always complete any dangerous job, their high prices and strict adherence to their religion often dissuade people from hiring them.
However, the Sisters do not tolerate situations becoming dangerous in areas they feel they protect.
The Sisters have been known to show up, remove a threat, and expect some payment or tithing to help keep their traveling Verses fed and armed.
