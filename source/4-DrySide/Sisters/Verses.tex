Groups of the Sisters called Verses patrol the dry side, seeking threats and looking for orphaned girls.
While people on the dry side know that the Sisterhood will always complete any dangerous job, their high prices and strict adherence to their religion often dissuade people from hiring them.
The Sisters have been known to show up, remove a threat, and expect some payment or tithing to help keep their traveling Verses fed and armed.
