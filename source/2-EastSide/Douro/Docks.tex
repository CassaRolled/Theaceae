Most of Douro is on the water, trying to find safety from the occasional raids that get past the patrols and defenses.
Half of the city is an amalgamation of docks and floating buildings.

The docks for the trade ships are the largest and most recognizable feature of Douro.
Carefully maintained and well guarded, there are often a couple of ships waiting here to unload trade goods or load up more tea.
Adventurers may find themselves waiting here for several weeks, but there is always work to be found in the docks while adventurers wait.
