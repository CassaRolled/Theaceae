The port city of Douro is the primary conduit for trade and travel in and out of Theaceae.
As the second largest city in region, Douro is home to 5,000 people.

Caravans between Douro and Camilla are limited, as most people only want to brave the jungles of the east side in the relative safety of numbers.
Individuals traveling to Camilla or the dry side may have to wait several weeks for the next trade caravan bringing trade goods to exchange for tea from the mountains.
More impatient individuals can find local guides through the jungles if they have enough gold and bravery.
