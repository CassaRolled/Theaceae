The families that own the plantations are the nobility of Theaceae.
While they largely abdicate governance of Camellia to the Governor, very little in the city happens without their approval.
There are five major families that hold sway, but there are a handful of smaller plantations that change hands every few generations.

During the growing season, the demand for labor is intense, and most of the town works for the plantations.
However, work on the plantations is limited in the winter, with only particularly skilled workers retained to process the high value and aged teas.
