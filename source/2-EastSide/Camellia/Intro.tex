The city of Camellia sits high in the foothills of the White Spine mountains.
Providing refuge from the Gnoll infested jungles that line the coast, Camellia is devoted to growing and processing tea.
Palisade walls protect the city while tea plantations dominate the land outside of the city, ringed by a set of ancient white stone watchtowers known as the Dragon's Teeth.

This city of 10,000 is confined to two square miles.
The population is predominately human and the most common occupation is working in the tea plantations.
Given the percentage of the safe farmland that is dedicated to tea production, food is twice as expensive as people from other parts of the world expect.
