Elves in town use the soup kitchen as a community center.
Situated in the middle of the elvish quarter, this structure is one of the most beautiful in town, with elegant relief carvings on its exterior.

Elves are welcome to stay here free of charge, and elves who take advantage of this offer are often invited to join the frequent caravans to the principal elvish settlement on the dry side, known colloquially as The Farm.
