The only seller of magical goods and components can be found in this ramshackle tower that seems to be barely standing up.
It looks as though the tower was formed by stacking ruined buildings atop one another.
Locals report strange lights coming from the tower at night and bizarre sounds at all hours of the day.

Regulus (CE human man, mage) is suspicious and paranoid.
He is willing to sell spell components and scrolls; however, he is unwilling to sell spell scrolls above the fourth level to anyone for fear of them becoming too powerful.

Regulus is reluctant to let anyone inside the tower unless they are willing to pay for his services.
Once inside, books, scrolls, and arcane apparatuses fill every available surface.
Spell services, spell scrolls, arcane supplies, and spell-casting focuses are available.
Note that rarer supplies are less likely to be available and more expensive.

Regulus apprentices locals that demonstrate arcane talent.
There are currently two apprentices in the tower.

Balbus (CG human man, apprentice wizard) is quiet and arrogant.
He resents and distrusts anyone who is not a wizard.

Porcia (CN human woman, apprentice wizard) is inquisitive and unpredictable.
She is always looking for ways to experiment and learn.
