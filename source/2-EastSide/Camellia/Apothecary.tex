The most well known apothecary in Camellia is on the edge of the elvish quarter.
Like most buildings in this area, the style tries to emulate the ruined elvish structures that can be found throughout Theaceae.
The cramped shop has jars and bottles neatly labeled in elvish containing spell components and potions.
Common potions are likely available, and more complex potions may be requested, though Valana may require the players to acquire ingredients for these potions.

Valana Yaeldrin (elf woman, druid) is disorganized and distractable, except when it comes to her potions.
She doesn't quite fit in with the humans, but she has steady business as the most capable apothecary in Camellia.
