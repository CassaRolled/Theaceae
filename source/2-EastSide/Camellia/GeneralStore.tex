One of the older warehouses has been repurposed for the largest general goods store in Camellia.
This wood structure smells strongly of dust and animal hair.
The shelves are overflowing when the biannual trade caravans visit town but can be quite bare just before these convoys arrive.
The general store stocks the gear found on the Adventuring Gear table in the Player's Handbook, at the listed prices. Food and rations cost double the listed price.

The purveyor, Richard MacCallister (NG human man, commoner) is calm and polite.
His spouse enjoys making weaving, so many of the supplies available will be made from yak or goat.
Purchases will be wrapped with goat hair twine or packaged in woven yak hair baskets.
