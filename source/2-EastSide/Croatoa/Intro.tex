Croatoa is the first settlement founded by humans in the region.
The town was abandoned, and all subsequent attempts to resettle the town have failed.

The town remains untouched and looks identical to the day the first settlers disappeared.
Local legends tell that anyone who visits Croatoa is cursed if they touch anything or, worse yet, take anything from the settlement.
