Theaceae is an isolated frontier region known for exporting luxury high altitude teas.
The White Spine mountains divide the region.
The foothills city of Camellia on the east side is nominally the capital, though settlers on the west side of the mountains tend to ignore this claim.
The east side has plenty of precipitation and rich tea plantations, but is plagued by Gnolls and other dangers in the jungles at lower altitudes.
The west side, or dry side, is generally safer, but the living conditions are harsher and the high altitude plains are ill suited for agriculture.
