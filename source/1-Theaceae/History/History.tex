The region was a haven for elves thousands of years ago, but only traces of this civilization remain.
Art and artifacts from the elves of this era are highly prized among the wealthy around the world.
The details of the disaster that ended the elvish civilization are not clear, but there are rumors of a large disaster that destroyed Sinensis coinciding with a dragon appearing in the region and hunting down elves for their treasure.

Legends of rich, lush plant growth during the height of the elvish civilization brought humans to the region approximately 500 years ago.
Rather than a bountiful region filled with plenty, these early settlers found an austere region filled with danger.
Some of the settlers carved an area of safety out of the region and began growing tea for trade, while others embraced the rugged environment and struck out on their own.
