Nobody knows where Trickery came from or what He wants.

Trickery ensures that even the best plans are disrupted.
Children like to blame Trickery for the broken pot and bandits like to say that they are agents of Trickery keeping everyone on their toes.

While Trickery does not solicit worshipers, He will reward those whose shenanigans amuse him with more ways to cause havoc and pull pranks.
