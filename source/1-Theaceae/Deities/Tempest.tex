Tempest is Nature's twin sibling in chaos.
There are some clerics that worship Tempest, but largely Tempest is more feared and respected than worshiped.
Some sorcerers also feel an affinity towards the Tempest and the unpredictable changes it brings forth.

As with Nature, most people believe that the chaos that Tempest brings is something to be weathered and endured.
Others believe that the chaos in the region is due to conflict between the two sibling gods and bringing these forces to a truce will bring peace back to the region.
