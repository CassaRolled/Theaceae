Tempest is Nature's twin sibling in chaos.
Where Nature is a force of creation and growth, Tempest is a force that brings destruction.

Various aspects of Tempest are believed to be responsible for the weather in the world.
There are stories of massive birds that are harbingers of particularly dangerous and fierce storms.
Few people have survived sightings or encounters with these birds, but those that have report beautiful plumage crackling with arcane energy.

There are some clerics that worship Tempest, but largely Tempest is more feared and respected than worshiped.
Some sorcerers also feel an affinity towards the Tempest and the unpredictable changes it brings forth.

Some believe that the chaos in the region is due to conflict between the two sibling gods and bringing these forces to a truce will bring peace back to the region.
However, most people believe that, as with Nature, the chaos that Tempest brings is something to be weathered and endured.
