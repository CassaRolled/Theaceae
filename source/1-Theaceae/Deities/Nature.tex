Nature has always been erratic, but in the time since the cataclysm that destroyed the elvish civilization the dominion of Nature has been even more unpredictable in Theaceae.

Druids typically have the closest affinity for and devotion to Nature, and clerics of Nature tend to have an affinity for the Nature domain.

Devotees of nature are split over the nature of the chaos in Theaceae.
Some believe that Nature was damaged by the elvish civilization and mortals need to aid Nature or convince Her to help Nature.
Others believe that Knowledge and Forge need to be used to temper the chaos of Nature and establish a new balance.
Most of the population however, seems to accept that this is the Nature of the world and they need to adapt to the chaos.
