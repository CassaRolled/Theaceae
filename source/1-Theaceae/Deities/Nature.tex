Nature has always been erratic, but in the time since the cataclysm that destroyed the elvish civilization Nature has been even more unpredictable.

Nature domain clerics and druids typically have the closest affinity for and devotion to Nature.

Devotees of nature are split over the nature of this chaos.
Some believe that Nature was damaged by the elvish civilization and mortals need to aid Nature or convince Her to do so.
Others believe that Knowledge and Forge need to be used to temper the chaos of Nature and establish a new balance.
Most people seem to accept that this is the Nature of the world and that they need to adapt to the chaos.
