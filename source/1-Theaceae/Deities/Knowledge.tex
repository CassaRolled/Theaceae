One of the two younger twins, Knowledge is seen as a guide for those who seek to understand the world as it is.
Unlike the siblings of chaos, the siblings of order are seen as aiding civilization.

It is believed that Knowledge prefers to remain objective and detached from the world in an effort to make unbiased observations.
As a result, various aspects of Knowledge are occasionally removed, as certain combinations of knowledge are known to create strong reactions.
Some of these aspects manage to survive and accrue followers and power of their own.

Sometimes wizards can be seen muttering a prayer to Knowledge under their breath as they try to work through a particularly difficult puzzle.
Clerics of Knowledge tend to have an affinity for the Light and Knowledge domains.

Followers of Knowledge tend to believe that she wants them to observe and understand the world so that they can better adapt themselves to chaos and survive.
