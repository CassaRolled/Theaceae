In the oldest elvish myths, She Who Creates created the world and the first gods.
She saw the world and wanted it to grow, so She created Nature.
However, realizing that growth unchecked created suffering, She created Tempest to balance the world.
Out of the chaos of Nature and Tempest came creatures craving order, so eventually She created Knowledge and Forge to help them learn and create.

She is seen as a benevolent and objective force of life and death.
Life and grave domain clerics often follow Her; however, they do not necessarily hope for direct intervention from Her.
Instead, they try to emulate Her and maintain balance between life and death in the world.

Culturally, this sense of balance is seen throughout the region.
Life is celebrated and death is mourned, but death is seen as a necessity for life.
"Life cycles as She wills" is a common expression for this perpetual cycle of life and death.
