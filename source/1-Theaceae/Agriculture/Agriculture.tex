The high altitudes in Theaceae make agriculture very difficult, resulting in food scarcity and limited options.
The produce on the dry side and foothills of the east side are exclusively leafy greens, root vegetables, and herbs.
The food in the jungles of the east side are more varied, but often adventurers are on the menu.

Hopps are difficult to grow at altitude, so ale is flavored with local herbs instead.
Even throughout the dry side, tea is a staple of the Theaceaen culture.

As a result of these restrictions, food and beverages cost twice the prices listed in the Player's Handbook on the Food and Drink table.
