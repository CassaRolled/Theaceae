Some homes and buildings are accessible deep under the rubble with only minimal damage while other buildings were completely obliterated.
Portions of the original streets remain untouched or have been excavated by various expeditions throughout the centuries.
In these uncovered buildings, any treasure or art has been removed and taken to the homes of tea families in Camellia or smuggled out of the region.

The expeditions have only been able to uncover the buildings on the outskirts of the city and a handful of buried streets.
Efforts to excavate deeper portions of the city have resulted in mysterious deaths as teams worked toward certain portions of the city.
Further expeditions have largely been abandoned, with only a handful of sporadic  efforts to quickly extract a handful of valuable artifacts, predominately coordinated by smugglers.
