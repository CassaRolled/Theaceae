High in the mountain pass between the east side and dry side lies the ruins of the ancient elvish capital city of Sinensis.
The city has been covered by a massive ancient rockslide, and the mountain peak above the crater has a large crater, weathered but still recognizable.
It's unclear exactly why the elves abandoned the city, but legends tell of a great monster that burst out of the mountain, destroyed Sinensis, and disappeared back underground.

Over the centuries, various groups have mounted expeditions into the ruins to recover art and artifacts.
Unfortunately, this work is highly dangerous and there are rumors of a wide variety of dangers in the subterranean remnants of Sinensis, to include ghosts of the previous citizens.

Hot springs and the crystal clear lake next to the ruins make the city a popular stop for travelers between Camellia and Wolff Point, but groups that have tried to stay longer than a few weeks have been found dead in their sleep.
