High in the mountain pass between the east side and dry side lies the ruins of the elvish city of Sinensis.
The city has been covered by a massive ancient rockslide, and the mountain peak above the crater has a large crater, weathered but still recognizable.
It's unclear exactly why the elves abandoned the city, but legends tell of a great monster that burst out of the mountain, destroyed Sinensis, and disappeared back underground.

Over the centuries, various groups have mounted expeditions into the ruins to recover art and artifacts.
Unfortunately, this work is highly dangerous and there are rumors of a wide variety of dangers in the subterranean remnants of Sinensis, to include ghosts of the previous citizens.
