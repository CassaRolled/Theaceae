Legends describe an ancient armory deep inside the ruins of Sinensis.
This armory is rumored to hold the arms and armor of the royal guard, to include some magical artifacts.
Some of the expeditions into Sinensis have been searching for this room, expecting to find great treasure among the weapons.

The floor of the armory is supposed to have a massive inlaid mosaic map of Theaceae and all of the elvish ruins throughout the region.
Other expeditions into Sinensis have been specifically looking for this map, hoping to find untouched treasures in lost ruins hidden in Theaceae.
