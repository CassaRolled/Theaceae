A few nights before the expedition members died, lights appeared, seeming to come from deeper below the ruins.
The night before the deaths in the expedition, guards or party members who were up late saw spectral figures brandishing weapons at the entrances to the buried ruins.
The few survivors all recount being woken by screams of terror in the night and seeing their fellow party members clutching their heads as spectral elves in intricate armor stab ornate weapons into their minds.
