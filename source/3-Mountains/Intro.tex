The White Spine mountains split Theaceae into the plentiful but dangerous east side and the safer but resource poor dry side.
With the exception of the trail between Camellia and Wolff Point, travel through the White Spine mountains is treacherous but profitable for those willing to explore.
Travelers should beware though, as the dwarves in the region are fiercely protective of teh location and contents of their mines.
