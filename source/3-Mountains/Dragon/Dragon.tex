One of the most popular theories about the downfall of the elvish civilization in the region is that without the protection offered by Sinensis a massive red dragon came to the region and began hunting the Elves for their art, magic, and treasure.
The evidence in the mountains and elvish ruins is inconclusive, but the theory remains popular, especially among young Elves.

Small bands of Kobolds sometimes attack explorers in the mountains, and if they are captured they often threaten to bring the wrath of the "Great Dragon" down upon their captors.
It's unclear if these encounters provide tentative support for this theory or if the Kobolds are merely full of bluster.
