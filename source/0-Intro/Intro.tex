Welcome to Theaceae, the land of people escaping away from civilization or seeking gold and adventure.
From the pirate infested seas and dangerous jungles to the tea plantations, the east side is full of opportunity for those willing to work for the tea families to risk defying them.
For more independent adventurers, the dry side of the mountains offers rewards if they can endure the harsh conditions and strange folk.
Separating the region, the White Spine mountains are rumored to hold the ruins of an ancient elvish civilization that was destroyed long ago, but the dangers that brought down this mighty civilization may still lurk.
