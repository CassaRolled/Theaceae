The adventurers have all joined a caravan headed from Camellia to the dry side and will depart in the morning.
The party has been invited to a dinner meeting with the head of the Tealeaf family in a room at the Saddle Gap Inn.
She is running late, but food is brought in and the party has an opportunity to get acquainted with one another.

Ms Tealeaf arrives after dinner and offers the party a job.
She explains that her young son, Finkas Tealeaf is a guide on the dry side and he has been hired to help a group of explorers looking for the Lost City of Gold.
Finkas was supposed to make it back to Wolff Point over six months ago and is overdue.
Ms Tealeaf would like any interested adventurers in the party to go looking for her son.
She will provide the party with tonight's lodging in the inn, provisions, and cold weather equipment if they take the job, and she will award 500 gp for Finkas's safe return to Wolff Point or 250 gp for word of his fate.
