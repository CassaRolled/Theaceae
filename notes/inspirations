Exploring Ruins:
There are lots of lost ruins with treasure and magic from the old elf civilization.
Plenty of treasure hunters try to find lost treasures, but few come away safely from their trips.

Post-Apocalyptic:
The story does a nice job capturing the sense of a world in transition and the remnants of a civilization falling apart.
The elf civilization fell much further in the past, but the sense is still appropriate.
  - Trail of Lightening

Exploration and Travel:
The region is expansive and spread out with lots to discover in between each of the main settlements.

Fey:
Fey are powerful, dangerous entities that are constantly fighting with each other for power.
